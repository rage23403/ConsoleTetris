# ConsoleTetris

To compile and run. Compile on inputManager.java

Game does have a "main" method but it's entirely for debugging in BlueJ. #BlueJ doesn't always garbage collect after it's finished executing.

inputManager is the main class because it's the way you can read for keyboard inputs

if the inputManager class did not exist you wouldn't be able to move around the tetris blocks.
You can tell this if you set your focus to the console prompt instead of the JavaFX Application.
