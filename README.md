# ConsoleTetris

To compile and run. Compile on inputManager.java

Game's "Garbo()" method is purely for debugging in BlueJ because sometimes it can run slowly and needs a garbage collection.

inputManager is the main class because it's the way you can read for keyboard inputs

if the inputManager class did not exist you wouldn't be able to move around the tetris blocks.
You can tell this if you set your focus to the console prompt instead of the JavaFX Application.

Pause button pauses the game's thread. Reset button resets the game and current score.
